                <h2>Sword Art Online</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: 20px; color: white;">Sword Art Online (ソードアート・オンライン, Sōdo Āto Onrain?) is a Japanese light novel series written by Kawahara Reki and 
                    illustrated by abec. The series is published by ASCII Media Works under the Dengeki Bunko label. It has been adapted into 
                    two anime series by A-1 Pictures which aired from July to December 2012 and from July to December 2014. The series has also 
                    been adapted into multiple manga series, with illustrations by Nakamura Tamako, Minami Juusei, Hazuki Tsubasa, Kiseki 
                    Himura and Nekobyō Neko and others. The series has also been adapted into multiple game adaptations.</p>

                <h2>Buttered Chicken</h2>
                    <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: 20px; color: black;">Basically it's a fried chicken dish where chicken pieces are lightly coated in a spiced breading mixture then deep fried 
                        to a golden state before drenched in a butter sauce. Almost similar to buffalo wings but without the chilli sauce. 
                        Each restaurant offers something differently, some have its own secret spices used, some are garlicky, some uses soy 
                        sauce which yields a darker colour, some uses a different starch to have a unique crunch but all of them gives that 
                        creamy buttery taste which makes people come back for more. Having said that, I won't be imitating their offerings 
                        since most of them are made with closely guarded recipes.</p>

                <h2>Ice Cream</h2>
                <p style="text-indent: 10%; margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: 20px; color: black">Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and sometimes other ingredients that has been frozen into a soft, creamy 
                    delight using special techniques. Ice cream has been a popular treat for hundreds of years but has only become 
                    commonplace since the widespread use of refrigeration. The exploding popularity of ice cream has led to a number 
                    of ice-cream variations including frozen custard, frozen yogurt, and even non-dairy versions made with ingredients 
                    like coconut milk.</p>
