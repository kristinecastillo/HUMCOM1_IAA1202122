        <h1 style="text-align: center;"><b>Steps on How to Cook Italian Pasta</b></h1>
        <br>
        <ol style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: larger;">
            <li><b>Boil Water</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Start with a very large pot of water, about 6 quarts per pound of pasta. 
                    <br>Bring it to a rapid boil. <i>Tip: A pound of pasta feeds about 5 to 6 people.</i>
                </dd><br>
            <li><b>Add Salt</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Put in a lot of salt, about 3 tablespoons. 
                    If you taste the water, it should taste like the sea.</dd><br>
            <li><b>Add the Pasta</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Drop in the pasta while the water is at 
                    a boil and give it a gentle stir.</dd><bR>
            <li><b>Stir</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size:large">Stir it occasionally while it cooks. 
                    Use the cooking time on the pasta package as a guide.</dd><br>
            <li><b>Taste the Pasta</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">But watch out — it's hot! Sample the pasta at about 2 minutes shy of 
                    the indicated time.<br> It should be al dente. You'll finish cooking it in the sauce. 
                    <i>Tip: "Al dente" means <br>"to the tooth,"</i> meaning the pasta should still have a little bite to it.</dd><br>
            <li><b>Drain</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Drain the pasta. Just be sure to save about 1 cup of the pasta water. 
                     you have a pot with <br>a colander insert, use it to drain the pasta. If not, drain the pasta in a
                      colander set in the sink.</dd><br>
            <li><b>Removing Ravioli</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">If you're cooking ravioli, use a slotted skimmer and gently lift the 
                    ravioli a few at a time.</dd><br>
            <li><b>Stir in the Sauce</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Add the pasta to your sauce and finish cooking it in the sauce. Give 
                    it a stir to coat.</dd><br>
            <li><b>Add Pasta Water</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Ladle a few tablespoons of the pasta water at a time until you have the 
                    right <br> consistency to your sauce. Remember, the pasta will absorb the liquid. <br>
                    <i>Tip: Pasta water helps to thicken the sauce</i>.</dd><br>
            <li><b>Buon Appetito!</b></li>
                <dd style="font-size: large;">Simmer over medium-low heat — it'll help the pasta soak up the sauce. 
                    Follow your <br>recipe's instructions for finishing the dish. And that's all there is to it.</dd>
