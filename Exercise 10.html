            <p>Anime refers to a specific
             style of cartoon produced or inspired by Japanese animation. Think of it this way: all 
             anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime. The art style associated with 
             anime is very unique and recognizable. You're probably familiar with the large eyes, wild 
             hair, long arms and limbs, and more. This exaggerated design helps the characters more 
             easily express emotions — of which there are plenty in anime. </p>

                <h2><b>Popularity of Anime</b></h2>
                <p>One of the main reasons why anime has stood the test of time and grown in popularity 
                    across the world is due to its unique ability to grow with its viewers. The famous 
                    anime expert, Takamasa Sakurai, claims that the genre has been widely accepted due 
                    to its unconventional nature, “Japanese anime broke the convention that anime is 
                    something that kids watch”. Overseas fans of anime claim that they enjoy the 
                    intensity of the storylines with the endings being difficult to predict as anime is 
                    often targeted at adult audiences.</p>
                <p>Anime has become more popular overseas in recent years due to a shrinking Japanese 
                    population leading to an increased export-minded trade. This has meant that anime 
                    producers have started to make content more suited to Western tastes, as well as 
                    producing anime overseas as it is much cheaper.</p>
